## UROC, ROCM and CPA in Python

The animated ROC movie (ROCM), the universal ROC (UROC) curve and the coefficient of predictive ability (CPA) generalize the classical ROC curve and AUC and can be applied to assess the predictive abilities of features, markers and tests for not only binary classification problems but for just any ordinal or real-valued outcome.
