### Data
Data is downloaded from either TIGGE (HRES) or ERA5 (Reanalysis for single level) at initialtime 00:00 UTC for the years 2007-2018. Note that for precipitation summation over hourly rainfall from ERA4 is necessary. Both wind speed (sqrt(u^2+v^2)) and 2m Temperature are instantaneous. From global dataset select box 335E,44.5E,25N,74.5N.
